The **Romans** knew it already **`"Sterzare Necesse Est"`** (free after Plutarch) and it is still valid in a **virtual cycling world**.<br>
<details><summary>What is means</summary>
    
The original quote **Navigare Necesse Est** ("Navigation is Necessary"), was humourously adapted here, by replacing **Navigare** with the Italian verb for [**steering**](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/sterzare), aligning it with the project's theme.

</details>

**Open Virtual Steering (OVS)** is an open-source project that explores interfacing with various **Human-Interface-Devices (HID)** for the **use case of steering control** in **virtual cycling platforms**.
It provides examples of alternative input methods for **navigating and positioning a cycling avatar** in a virtual world.

## üì¶ What Is This?

**BLESteeringServer** is an open-source, Arduino-compatible C++ library that provides a **reusable Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) server** implementation for transmitting **steering data** to virtual cycling platforms, for use with the **Espressif ESP32 SoC's**.

It is designed as a **shared backend** for projects in the **Open Virtual Steering** ecosystem and supports pairing with BLE clients that recognize a known **steering profile** used in commercial platforms.

## üìö Related OVS Repositories

This project allows users to explore a range of input devices for **steering control in virtual cycling worlds**. The emphasis is on **enhancing interactivity and user experience** through both **accessible** and **innovative** control methods.

> ‚ÑπÔ∏è The **VoiceControl** project is tightly coupled to the **XIAO ESP32S3 Sense**, which includes a built-in microphone and supports only **ESP32 BLE-Hosts**. A Bluefruit version is not applicable.

## ESP32 BLE-Hosts

There are two hosts, **ESP-Bluedroid** and **ESP-NimBLE**. The major difference between them is as follows:

+ Although both support Bluetooth LE, **ESP-NimBLE** requires less heap and flash size.

+ **ESP-Bluedroid** supports both Classic Bluetooth and Bluetooth LE, while **ESP-NimBLE** only supports Bluetooth LE.

## ‚ùì What is ESP-Bluedroid?
**Espressif** has modified a version of the native Android Bluetooth stack: **ESP-Bluedroid**. When you have installed the **Arduino core for ESP32**, the default BLE-Host is **ESP-Bluedroid**. The Bluetooth LE stack in ESP-IDF is a layered architecture that enables Bluetooth functionality on ESP32 chip series. It consists of two layers: the Bluetooth Upper Layer (BTU) and the Bluetooth Transport Controller layer (BTC).<br>
ESP-Bluedroid for ESP32 supports Classic Bluetooth and Bluetooth LE.

## üîß How the code works

With the **BLESteeringServer** library installed, developers can easily create applications that act as **dedicated BLE steering controllers** for use with **virtual cycling platforms**.

The user application is responsible for interfacing with a **Human Interface Device (HID)** ‚Äî such as buttons, a joystick, an IMU, or voice input ‚Äî and regularly passing steering data to the BLESteeringServer.

Once paired with a BLE client, the application uses `BLESteeringServer::updateSteeringValue()` to transmit real-time **steering angle data** over Bluetooth.

To ensure **interoperability**, the library implements a known **BLE Steering Profile**, which defines a consistent structure of services and characteristics used in commercial BLE steering devices. BLE profiles serve as an **application-layer contract** between the controller (peripheral) and the receiving client (central), ensuring compatibility across devices and platforms.

## üß™ Testing & Validation
The functionality of **Open Virtual Steering with BLESteeringServer** was tested using **standard BLE debugging tools** to ensure proper communication and responsiveness. One of the primary tools used was **nRF Connect for Mobile**, a widely available application for **scanning, connecting, and interacting with BLE devices**. This allowed for **verification of characteristic read/write operations, response timing, and general stability** of the BLE communication.  

## üîß Basic Usage

```cpp
#include <BLESteeringServer.h>

void setup() {
    BLESteeringServer::getInstance().begin();
}

void loop() {
    float angle = getSteeringAngleFromHID();
    BLESteeringServer::getInstance().updateSteeringValue(angle);
}
